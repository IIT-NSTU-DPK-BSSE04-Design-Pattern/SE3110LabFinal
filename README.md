# During Exam
## Code Refactoring & Design Pattern
* Students will fork an given github reporsitory under [https://github.com/IIT-NSTU-DPK-BSSE04-Design-Pattern](https://github.com/IIT-NSTU-DPK-BSSE04-Design-Pattern) and rename it **`<repo_name>_refactoring_<student_initial_name>`**
* Students will identify each code smell and refactor it with commit format: `smell: name of the smell, refactor: description of the refactoring`
* Students will generate the class diagram of that assigned repository and save it as `class-diagram.png` or `class-diagram.jpg` file

* _Students will **ONLY PUSH** the local repository when they are asked to do_
## Design Pattern Application
* Students will be given two scenarios for design pattern application
* For both scenarios, students will create a github repository under [https://github.com/IIT-NSTU-DPK-BSSE04-Design-Pattern](https://github.com/IIT-NSTU-DPK-BSSE04-Design-Pattern) with name formate as `design-pattern-application-<student-initial-name>`
* For each scenario, there will be two different packages under that repository
* Each package will contain the source files, image file of class diagram, a text file mentioning the rationale behind choosing that specific scenario
* During this part, students **MUST COMMIT ATLEAST ONCE** in every 20 minutes
* _Students will **ONLY PUSH** the local repository when they are asked to do_
